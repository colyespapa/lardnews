CLD, USFLR – The Lardish Government has finally appointed a new Prime Minister, after Juana Banana’s resignation earlier this year in July. The appointment of the country’s second-most-important person in the Presidential Cabinet was delayed due to disagreements in the Central Lardish Committee. The deadline for the Central Lardish Committee to approve the proposed PM seat by the current ruling party, the Lardish National Party, was July 10, however, the party couldn’t get an agreement on the CLC, instead, the Colish National Party, the runner-up from the last election, controlling 38 seats in the Committee, the minimum approved majority, decided to appoint Alexa Correa, the loser of the extraordinary elections last year, as the new Prime Minister. This decision was met with severe backlash by the LNP in the House of Representatives, the Deputies House, and the Senate, where the Lardish National Party has a minor majority, which means that they require votes in favor of the CNP or the Apple Lardish Party to propose a bill to the Supreme Constitutional Court to impeach Alexa Correa. The president of the Republic, Lard Lapudding welcomed her to the Presidential Cabinet and he supports the decision of the CLC to appoint her as PM. It is expected that in the following days, the President and the Prime Minister will appoint ministers of state.

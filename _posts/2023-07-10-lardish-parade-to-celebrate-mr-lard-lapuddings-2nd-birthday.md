The 2022 Presidential Lardish Parade was a military and street parade that took place in the Central Lardish Governmental Square, Tardish Square and Iktan Ikal located in the C.L.D., the (Sovereign) State of Tard and Mexico City.

The annual parade marks the birthday of the president and commemorates the birth of Mr Lard Lapudding 2nd on May 5, 2022, at 10:43 (CDT). The Lardish Government personally invited the Secretary of Education of the USFLR and its allies to attend the street parade in Mexico City. Mr Lard Lapudding 3rd congratulated Mr Lard Lapudding 2nd as soon as they met. Mr Lard Lapudding 1st gave his brother (Mr Lard Lapudding 2nd) a piece of advice and he suggested taking lunch with him the next day to talk about the country’s issues and more.

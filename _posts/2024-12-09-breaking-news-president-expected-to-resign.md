Palace of Lowx, Tard – Monday, December 09, 2024.

Insider information obtained from the Presidential Cabinet of the United States of the First Lardish Republic indicates that the President’s resignation is imminent, as reported by our journalists. They were invited to a press conference scheduled for tomorrow at the President’s official residence on December 10.

According to the insider’s report, the President is currently grappling with personal matters and was unanimously endorsed by his team to step down. He was re-elected President in the 2023 General Elections, defeating Mrs. Yuyu’s candidacy. He was inaugurated into office on January 20, 2024, and his term is scheduled to conclude on January 19, 2028.

The President’s approval rating remains exceptionally high, with 92% of the Lardish population expressing satisfaction with his leadership and the country’s management. Recently, he proposed constitutional amendments, which were approved in a historic bipartisan agreement.

However, it remains uncertain whether the President will resign or not. If he does, the succession process will be challenging, as the country faces internal divisions that could hinder the selection of a suitable leader.

CLD, USFLR – The Lardish Executive Power, consisting of the Lardish Senate, the Central Lardish Committee, and the President, has made official the dissolution of the Institute of the Lardish Language. The President said it was an unanimous decision taken by the CNP and the LNP in the Senate. “The decision to dissolve the institute was because the Lardish language has not seen a spike of daily people using it, and the vocabulary is minimal. The Institute was in charge of expanding the language’s vocabulary but clearly failed”. Now that the Institute has been dissolved, it is unclear what will happen next to the language, but it is expected that the President will submit a bill to the Lardish Supreme Constitutional Court to remove Lardish as a national language.

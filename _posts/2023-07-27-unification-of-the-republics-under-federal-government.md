After an attempt to overturn the result of the Three Lardish War, the former sovereign government, with the help of the newly established Peacekeeping Troops, launched an invasion of the Barld, Molty, Chessing, and the Central Lardish District. Royal Forces intervened directly in the conflict fighting the Sovereign troops, which they called ‘rebels’. An agreement was signed between the Sovereign Republic and the Royal Republic, with the Federal Government as a mediator. The three parties signed an agreement with the following points:

1. The Sovereign and Royal Republics shall unify with the Federal Government to establish the United States of the First Lardish Republic, with its capital city being the Central Lardish District.
2. The Lardish Federal Forces, the Lardish Air Force, the Royal Lardish Air Force, the Royal Lardish Ground Forces, the Royal Lardish Navy, the Sovereign Lardish Ground and Air Forces, and the Sovereign Lardish Navy will unify into the Unified Lardish Ground, Air and Maritime Forces.
3. The Peacekeeping Forces are subject to the direct rule of the Central Lardish Committee, the President, and/or the Minister of National Affairs.
4. The country will unify into a federal state, as established by the constitution, and become a semi-presidential republic.
5. The Peacekeeping Forces are subject to the direct rule of the Central Lardish Committee, the President, and/or the Minister of National Affairs.

These points were signed in the Definite Ceasefire Agreement of the Sovereign Lardish Republic and the Royal Lardish Republic by their leaders.

After the ratification, the three parties also agreed to introduce a new flag for the unified federal country. The flag is composed of blue, red, and green in three horizontal stripes.

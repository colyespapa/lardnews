The Central Lardish Committee decided not to impose economic sanctions against Russia, said Mr. Lard Lapudding 2nd in an emergency news conference regarding the Russo-Ukrainian war of 2022.

“We are not going to impose any types of economic sanctions against Russia because we need and want to have good relations with all the governments in the world, however, we do not support the 2022 or 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine.” Mr. Lard Lapudding 2nd stated when he was asked about the country’s position in the invasion of Ukraine.

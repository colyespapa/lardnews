CLD, USFLR – Lard Lapudding, President of the USFLR, acting on his duties as spokesperson of the Lardish House of Deputies, recently released the voting results on the proposal to amend Articles 1 and 38. The proposed bill includes the removal of Lardish as a national language and changing the country’s name from “the United States of the First Lardish Republic” to “the Lardish Republic”. He and his team proposed the bill at the beginning of this week, and today, Friday, November 15, 2024, it was received by the House of Deputies. The Lardish National Party, of which the current President is part, strongly opposed the bill, meaning that there is starting to be some division among his party. Overall, the results per party are as follows:

- **Coalition of the Lardish National Party and Lardish Fritos National Party (106 seats)**: 
    - Votes in favor: 40
    - Votes against: 66
- **Coalition of the Colish National Party and Lardish People’s Party (82 seats)**: 
    - Votes in favor: 72
    - Votes against: 10
- **Apple Lardish Party (16 seats)**: 
    - Votes in favor: 10
    - Votes against: 6

The bill required at least 120 votes for approval. With a total of 122 votes in favor and 82 against, the proposal has successfully passed in the House of Deputies and will now be passed onto the Lardish Senate, on which if it passes, it will become a law.

You can find the letter submitted by the President indicating the results here.

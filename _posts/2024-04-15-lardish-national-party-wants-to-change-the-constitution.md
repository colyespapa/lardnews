The Lardish National Party has suggested a change to the Lardish Constitution, this would be a radical change but almost inevitable and unavoidable due to the LNP having the majority at the Lardish Senate, and with the President’s support, the bill would be passed this month.  
The proposed bill would change the duration of the presidential term from two years to one year and allow the President and Prime Minister to hold office for as many times as they want, as long as the Senate and the Central Committee agree.  
Currently, the Colish National Party and the Fritos National Party, which ran for PM in a coalition with the LNP last year against the CNP, have opposed the measures and may be able to delay the bill’s passing.  
A spokesperson of the CNP has stated “This is completely unacceptable, the people are against this, that’s why they are doing it so silently, so no one notices, but the truth will always come out, one way or another. We will oppose this bill and will do everything in our hands to make sure it isn’t passed. If it is passed the Lardish democracy would cease to exist, this is why even the Fritos National Party has joined us against the LNP, which they were on a coalition for the President and PM positions last year. It’s incredibly bad that not even the parties that joined forces with them last year want to stay with them anymore.”  
The Lardish National Party’s president, Lard Lapudding has said “This is to make sure people like the choices they voted for, and if they regretted and the CNP manages to somehow win the next election, they could easily cancel the bill, and problem solved. But they don’t want that, because they know if that were to happen, the people would leave them with no seats in the Senate and they would cease to exist. As to the Fritos Party and the posture they’ve taken, all I can say is that they’re an independent party and they’re free to choose sides, and we won’t mind, even if they are on the morally wrong side.”  
As of today, the session to pass the bill is programmed tomorrow at 10:00 AM.

Becoming a Lardish Citizenship is easy for everyone and it’s important for us. To guarantee that the Lardish Republic is a safe place to live in, we have created the following requirements to guarantee citizenship.

1. Know Lardish Culture and History.
2. Fluently, properly, and effectively communicate in one of the official nationwide languages (Lardish or English).
3. Respect the country and its culture.
4. Respect the flag and the coat of arms.
5. Respect the Lardish national beliefs.
6. Have read, at least once, the Lardish Constitution.
7. Have visited, at least once, Lard Corporation’s website here.

If you meet all the requirements, you may be eligible to get the Lardish citizenship and the Digital National Identity Document.

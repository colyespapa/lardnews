Addressed to the citizens of the Lardish Republic

Lardish Citizens,

The full name, Lard Lapudding, is currently in use in the country by three people:

<div class="s4"><span class="s3">• </span>Mr. Lard Lapudding 1st (President)</div><div class="s4"><span class="s3">• </span>Mr. Lard Lapudding 2nd (Former King of the Royal Republic)</div><div class="s4"><span class="s3">• </span>Mr. Lard Lapudding 3rd (Former vice-president)</div>This has become confusing to some people; therefore, the Lardish Citizenship Committee has announced the removal of the “Lard Lapudding title” and the creation of the “Greatest Lardish Honourable Citizen”. This means that Mr. Lard Lapudding 1st will become Mr. Lard Lapudding and Mr. Lard Lapudding 2nd will become Tutita Col. Mr. Lard Lapudding 3rd will now formally lose the Lard Lapudding title and will not get another title as he is no longer a Lardish citizen.

Yours truly,

Spokesperson of the Lardish Government.

On May 2, 2022, Mr Lard Lapudding 1st, proposed a change to the flag’s design to the Central Lardish Committee, and it was approved by the Lardish Congress on May 4, 2022.

This design change will be valid starting on May 5, 2022. “This design change to the Lardish flag is something we all wanted to happen, but the previous dictatorships were too focused on themselves that they didn’t listen to their community needs, but after waiting for a very long time, here I am, ready to face all the challenges to change that old design to a new one my cabinet and I created based on the people’s suggestions, even if those challenges risk my royal position.” Mr Lard Lapudding 1st stated on May 1, 2022, one day before his proposal to the CLC.

Then, on May 3, 2022, Mr Lard Lapudding 2nd was informed about this decision and agreed.

“Mr Lard Lapudding 3rd didn’t give an opinion on such significant design change. However, even if he (Mr Lard Lapudding 3rd) hates this change, I fully support the king’s decision on the flag’s design change because, after many years of bad leaders, we can finally have leaders who care and listen to his people,” Mr Lard Lapudding 2nd, President of the USFLR, stated to news reporters of Lard News on May 5, 2022, his birthday.

Still, to this day, Mr Lard Lapudding 3rd hasn’t given his opinion to the Lardish Government.

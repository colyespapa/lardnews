On July 09th, 2023, the former Sovereign Government announced that they would begin a military operation to liberate certain states under Royal control. The President said that this decision was to defend democracy, as after the Three Lardish War, many states, previously under Sovereign rule, voted to become Royal. This certainly annoyed the Sovereign government as they only had 4 states out of 17 under their control. If you want to know more about the Three Lardish War, check out our article [here](https://www.lardnews.eu.org/2023/07/12/the-war-between-the-three-lardish-republics/). It didn’t make sense for some as they were the ones to suggest another election according to the third article of the treaty. There are many theories as to why the Sovereign forces invaded Royal and Federal territory, but the most likely is that, with the national elections coming up in 2024, they wanted to warn people of what would happen if they didn’t vote for the Sovereign-sponsored party, the Colish National Party for the presidency.

2\. Provide more specific evidence: While the text mentions theories about the Sovereign government’s motivations, it would be more effective to provide specific evidence or examples to support these theories. This would make the argument more persuasive and help readers better understand the situation.

3\. Use more concise language: The text could benefit from using more concise language to convey its message. For example, using simpler language and shorter sentences can help make the writing more accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, removing unnecessary details or repeating information could help streamline the text and make it more effective.

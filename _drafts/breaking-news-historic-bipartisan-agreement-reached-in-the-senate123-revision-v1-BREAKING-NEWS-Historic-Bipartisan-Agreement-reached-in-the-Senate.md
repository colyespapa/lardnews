CLD, USFLR – November 23, 2024.

In a plenary session, the Lardish Senate approved the bill to amend the Political Constitution of the United States of the First Lardish Republic (PCOTUSFLR), marking a significant step toward modernizing the nation’s legal framework. The bill, which required 28 votes to pass, secured 32 votes in favor and 16 against, thanks to a historic bipartisan agreement.

The bill addresses two key issues:

1. The removal of “Lardish” as a national language.
2. Renaming the country from “United States of the First Lardish Republic” to “the Lardish Republic.”

Here are the results obtained, according to the spokesperson of the Senate, Alexa Correa:

- **Coalition of the Lardish National Party and Lardish Fritos National Party (28 seats):**
    - Votes in favor: 14
    - Votes against: 14
- **Coalition of the Colish National Party and Lardish People’s Party (18 seats):**
    - Votes in favor: 16
    - Votes against: 2
- **Apple Lardish Party (2 seats):**
    - Votes in favor: 2
    - Votes against: 0
- **Total votes in favor:** 32
- **Total votes against:** 16

### Voting Breakdown:

The liberal coalition overwhelmingly supported the amendments, citing them as vital steps toward inclusivity and modernization, however, the conservative coalition seemed hesitant at first, as previously seen in the House of Deputies, nevertheless, after extensive negotiations, half of the conservative coalition supported the bill, contingent on assurances that cultural heritage would be honored through initiatives like a national historical institute. The Apple Lardish Party fully backed the amendments, emphasizing their balanced approach to progress and tradition.

### What are the Next Steps?

The Senate’s approval follows the bill’s successful passage in the House of Deputies, where it also garnered the required majority. The proposal will now proceed to the Central Lardish Committee, the only body authorized to amend and enact the constitution. The CLC is expected to review the amendments, at the latest, by December 6, 2024.

### Public Reactions

“This moment of bipartisan cooperation has been hailed as a victory for unity and progress. While some nationalist conservatives expressed concerns about preserving historical identity, the agreement reflects a shared commitment to addressing the evolving needs of our beautiful nation”, expressed Lard Lapudding in a press release.

These amendments signify a new chapter in the nation’s journey, balancing its rich heritage with the demands of a modern, inclusive society. All that is left is the final verdict from the Central Committee.

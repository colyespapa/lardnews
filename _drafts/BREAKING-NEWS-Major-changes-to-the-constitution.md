Lowx, Tard &amp; CLD, USFLR – November 1, 2024. The Federal Government has just passed a law that changes the Political Constitution of our country. The approved bill will officially change the country’s name from ‘the United States of the First Lardish Republic’ to only ‘The Lardish Republic’. The other change this bill is going to make is that the Lardish language will be officially discontinued and removed as an official language from the COnstitution. These changes were originally expected to take place until January 1, 2025, to give some time for people to get used to the changes, however, the Central Committee has ruled that the changes will take place immediately,

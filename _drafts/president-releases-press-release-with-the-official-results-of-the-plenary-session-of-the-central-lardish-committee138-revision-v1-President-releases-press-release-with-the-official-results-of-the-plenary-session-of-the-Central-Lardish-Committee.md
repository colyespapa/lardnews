CLD, USFLR – Friday, December 06, 2024.

Following the plenary session of the Central Lardish Committee to vote on the proposed constitutional amendments, the President was expected to deliver the results through a televised speech on November 30. However, he didn’t release any speech.

Two days ago, on December 04, he briefly shared the overall results with Lard News and other news chains but not the individual results per party or coalition.

In a press release today, Lard Lapudding announced the detailed voting breakdown and officially delivered the results to the Lardish Government.

Lard News was provided with the press release and you can find it here: [Official results CLC](https://www.lardnews.eu.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Official-results-CLC.pdf).

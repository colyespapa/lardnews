CLD, USFLR – November 29, 2024.

The meeting in the Central Lardish Committee to amend the Political Constitution will be held today at 16:00 (Central Lardish Time) in the Royal Palace of Lowx, Tard. Based on the stance each member has announced, we can project on the results, which will be delivered tomorrow in a televised speech by Lard Lapudding, President of the Republic and spokesperson of the Central Lardish Committee.

Based on the previous results documents, here is the official Lard News projection of the voting results in the Central Lardish Committee for the proposed constitutional amendments.

### **Proposed Amendments:**

1. Remove “Lardish” as a National Language.
2. Rename the country from “United States of the First Lardish Republic” to “the Lardish Republic”.

### **Previous Results**:

- **[![](https://www.lardnews.eu.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Projection-Outcome-CLC-Nov2924-300x191.png)](https://www.lardnews.eu.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Projection-Outcome-CLC-Nov2924.png)House of Deputies**: The proposal passed with 122 votes in favor and 82 against, driven by strong support from the CNP coalition, and the Apple Lardish Party.
- **Lardish Senate**: The proposal passed with 32 votes in favor and 16 against, reflecting a historic bipartisan agreement, reflecting the compromise of both coalitions.

### **Coalitions and Seats in the Central Lardish Committee**:

- Coalition of the Lardish National Party (LNP) and Lardish Fritos National Party (LFNP): 18 seats.
- Coalition of the Colish National Party (CNP) and Lardish People’s Party (LPP): 38 seats.
- Apple Lardish Party (ALP): 8 seats.

### **Analysis of Voting Trends**:

#### **Right-Wing Coalition (LNP)**

- At first, they seemed to be resistant to the removal of “Lardish” as a national language but showed partial support for renaming the country, especially after concessions in cultural preservation.
- **Projection**: 6 votes in favor, 12 against.

#### **Liberal Coalition (CNP)**

- The liberal coalition has supported these amendments in the lower and higher chambers, regardless of being proposed by a president who is a member of the right-wing party. And in the CLC, where the coalition holds a majority, there doesn’t seem to be a game-changing difference.
- **Projection**: 38 votes in favor, 0 against.

#### **Apple Lardish Party**

- Has shown partial support for the amendment and none of its members have taken a stance.
- **Projection**: 6 votes in favor, 2 against.

### **Projected Voting Results in the Central Lardish Committee:**

- **Total Votes in Favor**: 50.
- **Total Votes Against**: 14.

### **Outcome:**

The proposal is expected to secure ***50 votes***, surpassing the mandated majority of 33 votes (50% + 1) in the event of a Constitutional Amendment or Enactment. The amendments are expected to be approved.

### **Significance**:

This approval demonstrates alignment across the legislative hierarchy and emphasizes the Lardish Republic’s commitment to reflecting its evolving identity and compromise to move away from its “dark past”. Despite some conservative resistance, the process highlighted bipartisan collaboration.

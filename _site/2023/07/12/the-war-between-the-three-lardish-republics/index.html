<p>Today, the Sovereigns occupied the southern of the Barld, a Royal state, and after that, the Royals started an invasion of the northern and western Rouon and the northern Molty and used Eastern Colish territory to station a significant amount of their forces. The Federal Army reacted by sending troops to the Eastern Colish Royal-occupied territory. According to locals, Sovereigns were the first to attack, and soon after, the Royals announced their invasion of the Sovereign territory, however, there is no proof of these claims.</p>

<h3 id="march-02nd-2023">March 02nd, 2023</h3>

<p>05:00 am: The Sovereign Government has just issued a declaration of war and, in just one day, Sovereign forces have taken more than half of Barldi territory.</p>

<p>05:25 am: The Royal Prime Minister, to respond to the Sovereign declaration of war, has ordered a general mobilization of troops to the ongoing military operation on Sovereign territory and has authorized the Royal forces to use Eastern-Colish territory to attack the Northeast front.</p>

<p>Royal forces are sending some of their most advanced forces to the North &amp; Northeast United Front (Central Lardish District, Molty) through the state of Nuepia and have taken most of the state of Rouon. The Sovereign Government has temporarily moved its government headquarters to Montrain, Molty.</p>

<h3 id="march-03rd-2023">March 03rd, 2023</h3>

<p>Royal troops have taken the Malatentste borough of the Central Lardish District and the Gint and Yurting provinces of the Molty state and have fully occupied the Rouon. This was achieved by the North &amp; Northeast United Front Special Forces; however, they are also suffering losses as they have almost entirely lost the state of Barld. It is just a matter of hours before the Barld state if fully occupied. The Federal government urges all foreigners to leave the country as Federal leader, Lard Lapudding has invoked Article 17 to retake the Royal-occupied Eastern-Colish territory. It is also reported that the Federal forces will send troops to the Central Lardish District to stabilize the region.</p>

<h3 id="march-04th-2023">March 04th, 2023</h3>

<p>After the Federal government invoked Article 17, the Royals sent the Royal Special Troops to the Eastern-Colish territory to prevent a Federal liberation of the currently occupied Royal-territory, this caused a major pushback by the Sovereign and Federal forces in the Central Lardish District in less than 12 hours.</p>

<h3 id="march-05th-2023">March 05th, 2023</h3>

<p>Federal troops were unsuccessful with their “Liberation of the Eastern-Colish Territory” operation. After this defeat, the Royals relocated their 179th Division (which was stationed on the Eastern-Col) to occupy, through the North-Eastern front, the Molty. This is believed to have caused Federal troops to take the Jinkret Oblast of the Eastern-Col territory.</p>

<h3 id="march-06th-2023">March 06th, 2023</h3>

<p>Federal troops have opened a new front in the Eastern Tutitacol State, but Royal troops have succeded in the North &amp; Northeast United Front, as they have taken the northern division of the Central Lardish District. On the Eastern-Col territory, the frontlines haven’t changed.</p>

<h3 id="march-07th-2023">March 07th, 2023</h3>

<p>Mr. Lard Lapudding 2nd has just ordered a full mobilization of Sovereign troops.</p>

<p>Royal forces were pushed back on the Central Lardish District and the Molty state by the Sovereign Special Forces.</p>

<h3 id="march-14th-2023">March 14th, 2023</h3>

<p>After a new front on the E. Tutitacol was opened, Federal troops found very little resistance. Royal forces were kicked out of the CLD and Sovereign and Federal forces began a blitzkrieg operation to liberate the Royal-occupied Eastern-Col territory. Sovereign and Federal troops seem to be aiming to create a corridor in the northern part of the country, to encircle Royal forces.</p>

<h3 id="march-19th-2023">March 19th, 2023</h3>

<p>Royal forces, after intense fighting in Rouon, have closed the Sovereign East Corridor, with the purpose of encircling Royal troops. This is a major victory for the Royals, Royals troops have arrived in the Northern part of the Reaur to liberate it. The CLD is heavily damaged after an intense shelling by Royal forces. Royal forces have taken more than half of CLD territory.</p>

<p>### March 20th, 2023</p>

<h3 id="march-21st-2023">March 21st, 2023</h3>

<p>A peace treaty was signed by three parties.</p>

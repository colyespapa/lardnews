    <p>CLD, USFLR – November 27, 2024.</p>

<p>The Central Lardish Committee has announced through their spokesperson that their next plenary session will be held on Friday, November 29, 2024. The session will review the bill that would amend the Constitution, following its approval in the Senate and House of Deputies. For the bill to be passed, it does not require the typical 38 members-approved majority, as it is a constitutional amendment; instead, it requires at least 2/3 of the total membership of the Committee to be present, and the amendment would require 50% + 1 members of the total membership, so it would only need to secure 33 votes in favor. Furthermore, the left-wing and the right-wing coalitions, as well as the centrist Apple Lardish Party have expressed their support for the bill, therefore, its approval is expected by many analysts. If approved, it would mark a historic milestone in Lardish history and would allow the President to fulfill his campaign promises. As it currently stands, the left-wing coalition of the Colish National Party and the Lardish People’s Party has the approved majority on the Committee, and all of its members have promised that they would vote in favor; similarly, the Lardish National Party has expressed their willingness to help the President on achieving his goals for the well-being of the Lardish citizens. The Lardish Fritos National Party has not spoken on this issue, and insider information suggests that the party is split, the more radical conservatives have openly opposed the bill as it would destroy Lardish heritage, whereas the centrist-leaning members of the LFNP have divided opinions, but are expected to vote in favor.</p>

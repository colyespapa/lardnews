    <p>Monarchy City, Col State – The Western Col State Republic and the Great Col State Republic have finally reached an agreement to unify into a single state. The Western Col State will unify into the Great Col State, and the capital city of the new unified state will be Monarchy City, located right on the former border of both states. Both have agreed with the Federal Government to become a state, instead of a republic.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-this-happen">How did this happen?</h2>

<p>Following the Three Lardish War, after the peace treaty was signed by the leaders, it was established that the Great Col State could be divided into two republics using the old state division of the Eastern and the Western Col States. After General Elections were held in the states to choose which republic they wanted to belong to (Federal, Royal, and Sovereign), both the Western Col State and the Great Col State (Eastern) voted to stay with the Royal Republic.</p>

<p>After the Federal Government dissolved the republics and unified the country with a single federal government, located in the Central Lardish District, the division seemed unnecessary by both states, and, after their leaders met on July 01, they agreed to unify into a single state. The Federal Government authorized the unification on July 05, and the updated maps can be found on Lard Corporation’s website.</p>
